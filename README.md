you  need a pygame and a pyqt to run everything , the main window is game.py 

The Mobile Network Demonstration provides an exciting dynamic demonstrator of the way the modern wireless communication works.
The main structure of the program is simple which contains three parts: demonstrator, parameter modifier and initiator. 
Initiator is designed to change the most basic parameters in the demonstration (number of channels available in total ,speed of users , base station properties .etc).
 Parameter modifier allows the creation of base stations where the total number , channel allocation strategies and locations of different layers of base stations can be changed. 
The demonstrator is the core of the whole program , it provides a window with a changeable background of map and base stations. 
Virtual ‘pedestrians’ and ‘vehicles’ can be added to the map by clicking mouse and be highlighted by key ‘6’. 
The vehicles can only run on the road of the map and pedestrians are able to go anywhere (enter the buildings).
These two types of users are interacting with the base stations when moving and interfering each other when they are allocated to the same channel .
The whole demonstration can be paused or resumed by space bar.
Key ‘0’,‘1’,’2’,’3’ are designed to switch the view(show different layers).
